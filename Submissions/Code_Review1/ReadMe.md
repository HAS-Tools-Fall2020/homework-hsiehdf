Welcome Gillian! Please make yourself at home.

## Steps to Run my code

To review my code please download the latest streamflow data from the USGS website. Please name it "streamflow_week7" and make sure it is a txt file. You will need to make sure it is in a folder named "data" on your computer.

Then (I hope) all you need to do to run my code is to hit "run me" in each section of code. You will see comments in the code on what I would like you to predict for me!

Thanks!

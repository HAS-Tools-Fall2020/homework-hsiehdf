 - You could have skipped it all but thanks for providing the summary. And congrats on being undefeated champion!
 - You are right that is some pretty great looping!

I won the previous weeks prediction, therefore, I am inclined to skip my markdown... however, I will add a little bit of information because I'm not 100% sure I should skip everything in this markdown since this code is graded.

1. A brief summary of the AR model I built and why:

 I tried to build my AR model a few ways in the beginning. At first I tried to just use data from the last 3 years and only from September to October because I know flow is not a linear process. However, I got a terrible r2 of something like 0.05. So I thought my data points were too few and I increased my data to include the past 10 years and only got an r2 of 0.11. Therefore I abandoned that approach all together and chose to use all of the data from 1989 onward. This gave me an r2 of 0.40 and I figured that would have to do.

2. An explanation of how you generated your forecasts and why (i.e. did you use your AR model or not?)

 I did not use my AR model because it is predicting cfs of 163 and 207. I'm just looking at means and guessing that way!

3. Summary of Peer Evaluation

 I would just like to shout out Jill because she did an AMAZING job reviewing my code. Half the reason I'm doing this markdown is just so I can let you know how great and thorough of a job she did reviewing my code.

 With her help I cleaned up typo's, made my code a little shorter and clearer! She really did a great great great job.

4. Describe the part of my script I am most proud of and why.

 I am most proud of the looping I did to create a linear regression with a line of y = m1x1 + m2x2 + ... + m20x20 + b. Didn't help out my r2, but I am still proud of it.

1) What is the paper or project you picked? Include a title, a link the paper and a 1-2 sentence summary of what its about.
* I tried to recreate data from a paper published 3/9/20 on Nature Communications. The title is "Fresh groundwater discharge insignificant for the world's oceans but important for coastal ecosystems". Here is a link to the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15064-8#code-availability


2) What codes and/or data are associated with this paper? Provide any link to the codes and datasets and a 1-2 sentence summary of what was included with the paper (i.e. was it a github repo? A python package?A database? Where was it stored and how?)

* This paper used python code to generate their figures. They stored the data in a github repo here: https://github.com/ElcoLuijendijk/GroMPy-couple

3) Summarize your experience trying to understand the repo: Was their readme helpful? How was their organization? What about documentation within the code itself?

* I had high hopes when I found this article. It looked really similar to what we had done in class, however, the instructions for downloading the packages were not clear to me. Perhaps it is because I was not versed enough in coding yet, but what really stumped me was trying to navigate to an "src/bin" directory. I downloaded their escript package but did not see an "src/bin" directory. It's really unfortunate because their code looked really interesting. I was able to clone the repo and download the packages.

4) Summarize your experience trying to work with their repo: What happened? Where you successful? Why or why not?
* There were multiple python files, but I was not successful in running any of them. They had several codes and I tried to run a few of them. None of their print statements had parenthesis so I had to add them to make them work. Also the code didn't have any "# %%", but I added those and fixed that. I had more than half the code working in one of the files, but eventually reached a function that was not defined in the code and I couldn't find it anywhere in their repo. That was the ultimate stopper.

    I also couldn't get some packages/file paths to work right in other python files.

5) Summarize your experience working with the data associated with this research. Could you access the data? Where was it? Did it have a DOI? What format was it in?

* The data seemed to all be in the github repo all in python format. I could access them all, I just couldn't get it to run.

6) Did this experience teach you anything about your own repo or projects? Things you might start or stop doing?

* I learned I need to spell everything out as if users do not have much experience with coding. I understand how important it is to have something commented well so users understand what is going on. Perhaps a Jupyter notebook would be the better way to share data in a report.

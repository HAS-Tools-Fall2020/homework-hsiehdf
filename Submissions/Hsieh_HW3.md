## Summary of How I Made My Forecasts

I looked at previous years of September daily flow rates and mentally noted the lowest flow rates recorded. I then used those low rates to make my predictions. I think we will be getting below average rainfall from climate change.

## Assignment Questions
*1. Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they, what are they composed of, and how long are they?*
- Flow, Year, Month, and day are all lists, composed of integers, and 11,577 values long

*2. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?*
- For my predictions in September I said the flow would be 59, 40, 38, and 35 cfs for weeks 1-4. Below is a table that shows when daily flow were greater than my Sept predictions.

**Table 1 Daily Flows Greater than Predictions**

| Week |  Flow Prediction (cfs) | Times Daily Flow Greater Than Prediction  | % Daily Flow Greater Than Prediction|
|--- |  --- |  ---| ---|
|1|59|204|91.1%
|2|40|218|98.6%
|3|38|217|100%
|4|35|217|100%



*3. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)*

**Table 2 - Daily Flows Greater than Predictions Before 2000**

| Week |  Flow Prediction (cfs) | Times Daily Flow Greater Than Prediction  | % Daily Flow Greater Than Prediction|
|--- |  --- |  ---| ---|
|1|59|84|100%
|2|40|84|100%
|3|38|84|100%
|4|35|84|100%

**Table 3 - Daily Flows Greater than Predictions After 2010**

| Week |  Flow Prediction (cfs) | Times Daily Flow Greater Than Prediction  | % Daily Flow Greater Than Prediction|
|--- |  --- |  ---| ---|
|1|59|68|88.3%
|2|40|71|95.9%
|3|38|70|100%
|4|35|70|100%

The tables above show that the actual daily flow exceeded my flow rate predictions (which were really low) 100% of the time for every flow prediction for years before 2000. However, in years after 2010, my slightly higher flow predictions (59 and 40 cfs) did not exceed daily flow rates every prediction. This means that the actual flow rates are less from the years 2010-present compared to 1989-2000.

*4. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?*

- The flow generally decreased. The average flow for Sept 1-15 was 179.11 cfs. The average flow for the September 16-30 was 169.85 cfs.

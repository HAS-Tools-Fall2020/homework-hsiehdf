## Summary of How I Made My Forecasts

Using my handy dandy function I wrote I calculated the past week means and used it as my prediction for this week. For the following week I added 1 cfs since it appears that flow is increasing.


## Assignment Questions

*What is a dataset? Why did you choose it?*

I chose to use precipitation data because I thought precipitation data would be the best to see flow increases and trends.

*What location have you chosen?*
I chose the very beginning of the Verde River (34.8559, -112.45172). I figured precipitation data from the start of the river would be a good indication of how much flow would increase by the USGS stream gauge.

*Where did you get the data from?*
I used DayMet, but this turned out to not work out for me. DayMet only had data up until 12/31/19, so I couldn't actually use it to predict next weeks flow.

*What was your approach to accessing it?*
I went to NOAA station mapper and located a stream gauge at the beginning of Verde River. I then used DayMet to download precipitation data.

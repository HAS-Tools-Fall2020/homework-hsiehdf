I'm using my floater freebee markdown pass for winning the first half of the class competition.

Just for clarity I uploaded 4 things into my Week15 Submission folder:

  1) This markdown

  2) My python code I ran. I used google Colab as my extra non-computer method. This also contains my code.

  3) My output for Ocelote

  4) My pbs code for Ocelote

I have learned an **incredible** amount. Thank you!!
